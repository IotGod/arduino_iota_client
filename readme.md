# Arduino IOTA Client

This is a (very dodgy) IOTA client library for Arduino. Currently working on the esp8266. This is very much a work in progress.

Follow along with the tutorial [here](https://gist.github.com/lewisdaly/4c3b841cfd446a0459e78afc88b53e7e).


## Installation

```
$ cd path/to/your/libraries
$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:vessels-tech/arduino_iota_client.git iota_client
```
